# EGH400 Event-Triggered Consensus


## Semester One
Simulations this semester use 2-D double integrator agents. They are contrlller with state-feedback.

1. formation - shows formation control for a group of agents
2. skyway - the sky highway has five lanes. All lanes are self-regulated
3. skway_3x - 2. but sped up


## Semester Two

4.  skyway_sliding_mode_control
This simulation uses 2-D double integrator agents. A sliding mode controller is used. The sky highway has five lanes. The first (y=20) is a slow lane, while last (y=100) is a fast lane. There are fixed speed limits governed by a virtual leader.  Intermediate lanes are self-regulated.
